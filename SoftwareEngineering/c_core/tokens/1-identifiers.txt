identifiers are names given to various program elements such as variables, functions, arrays, etc. They serve as labels for these elements, allowing programmers to refer to them within their code. 

Naming Rules:

1] [a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _]
Examples: age, first_name, level_1


2] you can not start with digit
Examples:  1level 

3] special symbols are not allowed
Examples: C#code, @test

4] White-space are not allowed
Examples: first name

5] identifiers must be unique
Examples: bill = 50, int bill(){}

6] case sensitive
Examples: firstname, first_name, FirstName, FIRSTNAME, 

7] kyewords are not allowed
for = 10



Best Practices:

- Choose meaningful and descriptive names for identifiers to improve code readability.
- Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase) to enhance code maintainability.
