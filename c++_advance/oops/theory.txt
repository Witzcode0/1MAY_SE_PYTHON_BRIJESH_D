Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to organize software design. C++ is an extension of the C programming language and incorporates features that facilitate OOP. Here are the key concepts and their implementation in C++:

1] class and objects
    - attribute or property
    - function or method
2] encapsulation
    - access specifiers
    - constructor and destructor
    - getter and setter method
3] inheritance
    - types of inheritance:
        - single
        - multilevel
        - multiple
        - hirarchical
        - hybrid
4] abstraction
5] polymorphisum
    - compile time
    - run time

- friend function
- inline function
- virtual function
