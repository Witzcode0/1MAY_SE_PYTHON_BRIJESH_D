%u: Formats and prints unsigned integers.
%ld: Formats and prints long integers.
%lu: Formats and prints unsigned long integers.
%lld: Formats and prints long long integers.
%llu: Formats and prints unsigned long long integers.
%x: Formats and prints integers in hexadecimal notation.
%o: Formats and prints integers in octal notation.
%e: Formats and prints floating-point numbers in scientific notation.
%g: Formats and prints floating-point numbers in either decimal or scientific notation, whichever is more compact.
%X: Similar to %x, but prints hexadecimal numbers in uppercase.
%o: Prints integers in octal notation.
%n: Used to store the number of characters printed so far.
%i: Similar to %d, used to format and print integers in base 10, octal, or hexadecimal based on the prefix.
