a loop is a control flow statement that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. 

for loop: It is used when you know the number of iterations in advance. It consists of an initialization, a condition, and an increment/decrement expression.

syntax: 
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement/update_initialization) {
    // code to be executed
}


while loop: It is used when you want to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.

syntax:
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}


do-while loop: It is similar to the while loop, but it always executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition.

syntax:
do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);
