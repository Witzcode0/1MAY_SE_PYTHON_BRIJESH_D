Keywords: keywords are reserved words that are predefined by the language and have special meanings and purposes. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) because they are reserved for specific syntactical purposes in Python.

Available Keywords:

False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield


False: Boolean value representing false in logical expressions.
None: Represents the absence of a value, often used as a default or placeholder.
True: Boolean value representing true in logical expressions.
and: Logical operator used to combine two conditional statements with "and".
as: Used to create an alias when importing a module or part of a module.
assert: Used for debugging purposes to test a condition in the program.
async: Declares a function as asynchronous, allowing it to run concurrently with other functions.
await: Pauses the execution of an asynchronous function until a specified coroutine is completed.
break: Exits from the innermost loop or switch statement.
class: Defines a new class, which is a blueprint for creating objects.
continue: Skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration.
def: Defines a function or method.
del: Deletes a reference to an object, allowing the garbage collector to reclaim memory.
elif: Stands for "else if", used in conditional statements.
else: Specifies a block of code to be executed if the condition in the if statement is false.
except: Catches and handles exceptions raised in a try block.
finally: Specifies a block of code that will be executed, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.
for: Iterates over items of a sequence (such as lists, tuples, or strings).
from: Used in import statements to specify what parts of a module to import.
global: Declares a variable inside a function as global, allowing it to be accessed outside the function.
if: Specifies a block of code to be executed if a specified condition is true.
import: Used to import modules or specific functions/classes from modules.
in: Used to check if a value is present in a sequence (such as lists, tuples, or strings).
is: Evaluates if two variables point to the same object in memory.
lambda: Creates an anonymous function.
nonlocal: Declares a variable to be a nonlocal variable of the enclosing function.
not: Logical operator used to reverse the boolean value of a condition.
or: Logical operator used to combine two conditional statements with "or".
pass: Used as a placeholder where syntactically a statement is required but no action is needed.
raise: Used to raise an exception.
return: Exits from a function and optionally returns a value.
try: Specifies a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
while: Specifies a block of code to be executed as long as a specified condition is true.
with: Used to simplify exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks.
yield: Pauses a function and saves its state so that it can be resumed later.
