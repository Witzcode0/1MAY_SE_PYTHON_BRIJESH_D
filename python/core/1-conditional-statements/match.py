"""
Match : the match statement (also known as match-case or match-expressions) is introduced in Python 3.10 as a new way to perform pattern matching. Pattern matching allows you to check if a value matches a certain pattern and then execute code based on that pattern. It's similar to switch or case statements found in other programming languages.

match expression:
    case pattern1:
        # block of code to execute if expression matches pattern1
    case pattern2:
        # block of code to execute if expression matches pattern2
    ...
    case patternN:
        # block of code to execute if expression matches patternN
    case _:
        # default case (optional), executed if no patterns match
