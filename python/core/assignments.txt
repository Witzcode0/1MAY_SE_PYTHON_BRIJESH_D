1. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

2. Create a program that calculates the sum of the first 100 natural numbers using a while loop.

3. Write a program to compute the factorial of a number (input from the user) using a for loop.

4. Given a list of numbers, use a for loop to print each number squared.

5. Write a program that counts how many even and odd numbers are in a list.

6. Create a program that prints numbers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz."

7. Write a program that takes a string input from the user and prints it in reverse using a for loop.

8. Generate a multiplication table for numbers 1 to 10 using nested loops.
